# `gtee`

The Go implementation of `tee`, a GNU Coreutils tool. The original implementation in C can be checked on [here](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/tee.c).

Even though the core logic is implemented, the program is still in experimental state (WIP, basically) due to the fact that tests are not completed yet.

This README will be updated once the tests are finalized and the initial version is ready to be distributed.
